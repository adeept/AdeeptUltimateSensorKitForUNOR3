Description: This example will show you how to use the setBits() 
             function of this library.Set any combination of 
             LEDs using 10 bits.
             The setBits() function sets the current state, 
             one bit for each LED.First 10 bits from the right
             control the 10 LEDs.
             eg. 0b00000jihgfedcba
             a = LED 1, b = LED 2, c = LED 3, etc.
             dec    hex     binary
             0    = 0x0   = 0b000000000000000 = all LEDs off
             5    = 0x05  = 0b000000000000101 = LEDs 1 and 3 on, all others off
             341  = 0x155 = 0b000000101010101 = LEDs 1,3,5,7,9 on, 2,4,6,8,10 off
             1023 = 0x3ff = 0b000001111111111 = all LEDs on
                      |        |
                      10       1.
